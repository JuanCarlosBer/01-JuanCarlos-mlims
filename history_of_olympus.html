        <h2>Why the Olympus was created?</h2>
        <div class="Olympus_text row">
            <p class="col-6">Mount Olympus was the mythical home of the 12 gods in Ancient Greek history. According to
                the myth, the
                mountain was created after the Titanomachy, an epic battle between the young Olympians gods and the
                Titans.
                When the Olympian gods won the battle, they created their new majestic home – Mount Olympus. The
                mountain
                was shrouded from human eyes by clouds which constantly obscured its peaks.All 12 Olympian gods resided
                in
                the mountain;

            <p class="col-6">
                Zeus and his wife Hera, Athena, Artemis, Poseidon, Apollo, Hester, Demeter, Aphrodite, Hermes,
                Ares, and Hephaestus. They would meet daily in Zeus palace in the Pantheon, to discuss the fate of the
                mortals. Below the Pantheon was Zeus’ Throne – known today as Stefani – from where he would rule both
                gods
                and men, hurling thunderbolts to those who disobeyed him. Once the God of War protagonist said:</p>
            <blockquote>"If all
                in the Olympus denies my vengeance then all the Olympus will die"</blockquote><cite>--Kratos -The ghost
                of Sparta.</cite>

                Kronos,The titan god. His father gave birth to his siblings the gods of olympus. The gods ruled the
                heavens
                and earth. The gods each had their own unique power to control certain elements and life in both worlds.
                But
                zeus had the most powerful power of all of the gods combined. Zeus could control the lighting and the
                thunder earning him the nickname the “Thunderer”. (cartwright).</p>
            <p class="col-6">
                The people of greece worshipped him and
                respected him and his teachings. They had the first olympics in his honour. So many cults in his name
                were
                made in greece to honour him and his wonderful name.
