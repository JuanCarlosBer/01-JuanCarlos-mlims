        <h2>Why the Olympus was created?</h2>
        <p>Mount Olympus was the mythical home of the 12 gods in Ancient Greek history. According to the myth, the
            mountain was created after the Titanomachy, an epic battle between the young Olympians gods and the Titans.
            When the Olympian gods won the battle, they created their new majestic home – Mount Olympus. The mountain
            was shrouded from human eyes by clouds which constantly obscured its peaks.All 12 Olympian gods resided in
            the mountain; Zeus and his wife Hera, Athena, Artemis, Poseidon, Apollo, Hester, Demeter, Aphrodite, Hermes,
            Ares, and Hephaestus. They would meet daily in Zeus palace in the Pantheon, to discuss the fate of the
            mortals. Below the Pantheon was Zeus’ Throne – known today as Stefani – from where he would rule both gods
            and men, hurling thunderbolts to those who disobeyed him.

        <blockquote>
            Kronos,The titan god. His father gave birth to his siblings the gods of olympus. The gods ruled the heavens
            and earth. The gods each had their own unique power to control certain elements and life in both worlds. But
            zeus had the most powerful power of all of the gods combined. Zeus could control the lighting and the
            thunder earning him the nickname the “Thunderer”. (cartwright). The people of greece worshipped him and
            respected him and his teachings. They had the first olympics in his honour. So many cults in his name were
            made in greece to honour him and his wonderful name.
