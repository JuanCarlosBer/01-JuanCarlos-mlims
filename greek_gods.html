                    <dt><strong>ZEUS</strong></dt>
                    <dd class="p_zeus">In Greek mythology, Zeus is a divinity that is sometimes called the "father of
                        gods and men",
                        who
                        governs the gods of Olympus as a father to a family, so that even those who were not his natural
                        children address him as such. He is the king of the gods and oversees the universe. He is the
                        god
                        of the sky and thunder and therefore of energy. His attributes include the scepter and crown (as
                        symbols of his power), lightning, eagle, bull, and oak. In addition to his Indo-European
                        heritage,
                        the classical "cloud-gatherer" Zeus also derived certain iconographic traits from ancient Near
                        Eastern cultures, such as the scepter. Zeus was commonly depicted by Greek artists in two poses:
                        standing, advancing with a raised thunderbolt in his right hand, and sitting regally.</dd>

                    <dd class="p_ares">In Greek mythology Ares (in ancient Greek <i>Ἄρης</i>, in modern
                        Greek,<i>Ἄρη)</i>, son of Zeus
                        and Hera, is the
                        Olympian god of war.
                        In war it represents brutality, violence and the horrors of battles.1 As the god of male
                        virility
                        throughout mythology, there have been some thirty female lovers, with an offspring of around 60
                        children (among them Eros , Harmony, Phobos, Deimos, the Amazons). Aphrodite, goddess of love
                        and
                        beauty, was his favorite lover, his healer, and ally in war. Its Roman equivalent is Mars.</dd>

                    <dd class="dt_gods"><strong>POSEIDON</strong></dd>
                    <dd class="p-poseidon">Poseidon1 or Poseidon2 (Ancient Greek: <i>Ποσειδῶν3</i>, Romanization:
                        Poseidỗn, pronunciation:
                        Classical:
                        <i>poseːdɔ́ː̀n</i>, Koiné: <i>po̞sidˈo̞ːn</i>, Byzantine: <i>posiðˈon</i>) is the god of the
                        seas and, as "Agitator of
                        the Earth", of earthquakes Greek mythology. The name of the Etruscan sea god Nethuns was adopted
                        in
                        Latin for Neptune (Neptunus) in Roman mythology, both sea gods being analogous to Poseidon.

                        The Linear B tablets show that Poseidon was venerated at Pylos and Thebes in late Bronze Age
                        Mycenaean Greece, but was integrated into the later Olympian pantheon as the brother of Zeus and
                        Hades. Poseidon had many children and was protector of many Hellenic cities, although he lost
                        the
                        contest for Athens against Athena. He was dedicated a Homeric hymn. Like other sea gods, he was
                        represented in the form of a horse.

                    <dd class="dt_gods"><strong>DEMETER</strong></dd>
                    <dd>Demeter or Demetra (in ancient Greek <i>Δημήτηρ</i> or <i>Δημητρα</i>, 'mother goddess' or
                        perhaps
                        'distributing mother', perhaps from the Indo-European noun *<i>dheghom</i> *<i>mater</i>) is the
                        Greek goddess of
                        agriculture, pure nurturer of green and young earth, life-giving cycle of life and death. She is
                        revered as the "bringer of the seasons" in a Homeric hymn, a subtle sign that she was worshiped
                        long
                        before the arrival of the Olympians. The Homeric hymn to Demeter dates from about the 7th
                        century
                        BCE. C.3 Together with his daughter Persephone they were the central characters of the
                        Eleusinian
                        mysteries that also preceded the Olympian pantheon.

                        In Roman mythology, Demeter was associated with Ceres. When Demeter was given a genealogy, it
                        was
                        said that she was the daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea (both sons of Gaea and Uranus), and
                        therefore the older sister of Zeus. Their priestesses were given the title of Melissas.
