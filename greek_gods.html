            <h1><u>GODS</u></h1>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>ZEUS</strong></dt>
                <dd>In Greek mythology, Zeus is a divinity that is sometimes called the "father of gods and men",1 who
                    governs the gods of Olympus as a father to a family, so that even those who were not his natural
                    children address him as such.2 He is the king of the gods and oversees the universe.3 He is the god
                    of the sky and thunder and therefore of energy. His attributes include the scepter and crown (as
                    symbols of his power), lightning, eagle, bull, and oak. In addition to his Indo-European heritage,
                    the classical "cloud-gatherer" Zeus also derived certain iconographic traits from ancient Near
                    Eastern cultures, such as the scepter. Zeus was commonly depicted by Greek artists in two poses:
                    standing, advancing with a raised thunderbolt in his right hand, and sitting regally.</dd>

                <dt><strong>ARES</strong></dt>
                <dd>In Greek mythology Ares (in ancient Greek <i>Ἄρης</i>, in modern Greek,<i>Ἄρη)</i>, son of Zeus and Hera, is the
                    Olympian god of war.
                    In war it represents brutality, violence and the horrors of battles.1 As the god of male virility
                    throughout mythology, there have been some thirty female lovers, with an offspring of around 60
                    children (among them Eros , Harmony, Phobos, Deimos, the Amazons). Aphrodite, goddess of love and
                    beauty, was his favorite lover, his healer, and ally in war. Its Roman equivalent is Mars.</dd>

                <dt><strong>POSEIDON</strong></dt>
                <dd>Poseidon1 or Poseidon2 (Ancient Greek: Ποσειδῶν3, Romanization: Poseidỗn, pronunciation: Classical:
                    poseːdɔ́ː̀n, Koiné: po̞siːdˈo̞ːn, Byzantine: posiðˈon) is the god of the seas and, as "Agitator of
                    the Earth", of earthquakes Greek mythology. The name of the Etruscan sea god Nethuns was adopted in
                    Latin for Neptune (Neptunus) in Roman mythology, both sea gods being analogous to Poseidon.

                    The Linear B tablets show that Poseidon was venerated at Pylos and Thebes in late Bronze Age
                    Mycenaean Greece, but was integrated into the later Olympian pantheon as the brother of Zeus and
                    Hades. Poseidon had many children and was protector of many Hellenic cities, although he lost the
                    contest for Athens against Athena. He was dedicated a Homeric hymn. Like other sea gods, he was
                    represented in the form of a horse.</dd>
                <dt><strong>DEMETER</strong></dt>
                <dd>Demeter1​ or Demetra2​ (in ancient Greek Δημήτηρ or Δημητρα, 'mother goddess' or perhaps
                    'distributing mother', perhaps from the Indo-European noun *dheghom *mater) is the Greek goddess of
                    agriculture, pure nurturer of green and young earth, life-giving cycle of life and death. She is
                    revered as the "bringer of the seasons" in a Homeric hymn, a subtle sign that she was worshiped long
                    before the arrival of the Olympians. The Homeric hymn to Demeter dates from about the 7th century
                    BCE. C.3 Together with his daughter Persephone they were the central characters of the Eleusinian
                    mysteries that also preceded the Olympian pantheon.

                    In Roman mythology, Demeter was associated with Ceres. When Demeter was given a genealogy, it was
                    said that she was the daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea (both sons of Gaea and Uranus), and
                    therefore the older sister of Zeus. Their priestesses were given the title of Melissas.
